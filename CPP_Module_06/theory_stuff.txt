=================== Ex00 =================
=> what is casting: is the mechanism of converting a data type to another type.

=> types of casting operators:
		=> static_cast: is the most commonly used one, it performs a compile-time type conversion and is mainly used for 
						explicit converstions that are considered safe by the compiler.
		
		=> dynamic_cast: is used only to perform downcasting (converting a pointer/reference of a base class to a derived class)
						in polymorphisms and inheritance. it ensures type safety by performing a runtime check to verify the 
						validity of the convertion. If the convertion is not possible, dynamic_cast returns a
						NULL pointer (for pointer convertions) or throws a bad_cast exception (for references).

		=> const_cast: is used to modify the const or volatile qualifier of a variable. It allows a programmer to temporarily remove the constancy of an object
						and make modifications. Caution must be exercised when using const_cast, as modifying a const object can lead to undefined behavior.

		=> reinterpret_cast: is used to convert a pointer to any other type of pointer. It does not perform any check whether the pointer converted is of the
						same type or not.

		note: const_cast and reinterpret_cast are not recommended as they vulnerable to different kinds of errors.

============== Ex01 =============
=> uintptr_t: is defined as unsigned long int, it used because it matches the size of pointers on most archs 32bits => 4bytes, 64bits => 8bytes, that makes it 
			able to hold any pointer value, making it safer and portable across different architectures.


=> dynamic_cast relys on RTTI (runtime type information) to do it's job, and this what makes it safe for type conversions, RTTI are a mechanism that exposes infos about
		an object's data type at runtime and is available only for the classes which have at least one virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution.
