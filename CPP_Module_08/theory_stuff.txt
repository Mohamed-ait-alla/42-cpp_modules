========== general stuff ============

=> what a container: is an object that stores a collection of objects of a specific type. in c++ we have different types of 
					containers:

			--> Sequential containers: allow us to store elements that can be accessed in sequential order (means the way
										they inserted, the way they printed), examples of that type are, Array, Vector, Deque, List, Forward List.

			--> Associative containers: allow us to store elements in sorted order, means the way they inserted, when they printed it sorted first
										and then printed with duplicate numbers removed. examples of that type are Set, Map, Multiset, Multimap.

			--> Unordered Associative containers: this type provides the unsorted versions of the associative container.
													they are implelmented as hash table data structures. in this type the inserted data printed unsorted
													and with duplicate values removed.

			--> Container adapters: provide a restricted interface to make them behave differently.
									examples of that type, stack, Queue, Priority queue, For example a stack is a container adapter that uses the sequential
									'Deque' and provides a restricted interface to support push() and pop() operations only.
